## Problem Statement

With the resurgence of travel following the COVID-19 pandemic, our objective is to develop an advanced predictive model tailored for travel agencies. The model aims to assist travel agencies in providing their customers with personalized recommendations for securing the most cost-effective flight options from a specific airport. By leveraging historical data, the model will predict optimal timeframes for lower-priced flights, enabling travel agencies to offer strategic advice to their customers. This initiative seeks to enhance customer satisfaction, streamline the booking process, and empower travel agencies with actionable insights to navigate the dynamic landscape of airfare pricing and seasonal trends. The model will attempt to optimize for RMSE in order to make our performance as accessible as possible.
